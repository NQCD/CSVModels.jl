# CSVModels
This package contains a type of NQCModel which takes a Matrix of positions and potential values as an input to fit a spline to. 
Currently, only a one-dimensional adiabatic model is implemented: `CSVModel_1D`
Importing the table of positions and potential values is left to the user since CSV files come in too many different flavours.
